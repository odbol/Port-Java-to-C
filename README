This script takes an Java file and auto-ports it to C++. Well, the obvious boring stuff anyway:
It will replace certain Java keywords and types with their equivalents in C++, as well as generate
separate header and implementation files for you (header files are so 1980's). 

Disclaimer: *This is not Skynet*. It will definitely NOT generate code that compiles, except in the
most basic case. It just does the boring work for you like typing everything twice, etc. Then you
can get on with the fun stuff like dereferencing pointers, memory management, and all that you know
and love about C.
